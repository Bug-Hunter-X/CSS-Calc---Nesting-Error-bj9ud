The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but there's a common error when using nested `calc()` expressions without proper spacing and parentheses. For example, the following code will lead to unexpected results because of operator precedence issues:  `width: calc(calc(100% - 20px) - 10px);` It should be written as `width: calc(100% - 20px - 10px);` or `width: calc((100% - 20px) - 10px);`
