The corrected code uses proper spacing and parentheses to ensure the calculation is performed correctly.  The expression `width: calc(100% - 20px - 10px);` avoids nested `calc()` altogether, performing the subtraction directly.  Alternatively, `width: calc((100% - 20px) - 10px);` uses parentheses to define the order of operations explicitly. Both solutions resolve the unexpected calculation issue.
